# Configuring the Runtime View

## Big picture

View vulnerable images running your Managed Clusters.

## Value

Runtime View collects image information from the pods running your Managed Clusters. This information
is linked to uploaded image scan results, allowing you to view the image vulnerabilities in you Managed Clusters.

## How does the Runtime View collect image information from my Managed Clusters

When Runtime View is enabled, {{prodname}} deploys a Daemonset, named "Crawdad", into your connected Managed Clusters to
actively monitor pods running in your Kubernetes clusters and gather image information from the nodes
they're running on. This information is used to correlate the images your pods are running with the images you
have upload scan results for.

:::note

The "Crawdad" Daemonset requires root privileges and host networking.

## Before you begin

**Required**

Ensure the path to your CRI socket is configured correctly.

**Configuring the CRI socket path for Managed Cluster**

Some Kubernetes clusters use different CRI binaries other than the default containerd one, or the containerd CRI socket
might be located other than the default location. If the Crawdad Pods running in your Managed Cluster don't have the correct
location of the CRI socket, they won't be able to gather image information for the pods running in your cluster.

Other than containerd, we know of two other CRI implementations (there may be others):
1. cri-dockerd, whose socket path is at `/var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.
2. dockershim, whose socket path is at `/var/run/dockershim.sock`

To update the CRI socket path for the Crawdad Pods use the following command:
```bash
kubectl patch imageassurance default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"criSocketPath":"<path-to-cri-socket"}}'
```

We know that some kubernetes platforms or k8s versions use different CRI binaries, here are some examples of where we
know the CRI socket path is different from the default:
1. Rancher uses cri-dockerd, so the CRI socket path should be located at `/var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.
2. EKS installations with kubernetes version lower than 1.23 use docker shim, located at `/var/run/dockershim.sock`
3. RKE2 installation use containerd but it's located at `/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock`

See [the installation reference](../reference/installation/api.mdx#image-assurance.operator.tigera.io/v1.ImageAssuranceSpec) for more details on the ImageAssurance CR.

**Enable Runtime View**

To enable the Runtime View go to the Scan Settings and check the "Enable Runtime View" box. The settings can be
accessed by clicking the gear on the right side of the page in the Scan Results tab.

By default, this feature is disabled. If you disable the feature after it has been enabled, runtime information that was
already collected will persist.
