# Change the Runtime View CRI socket path.

## Big picture

Change the CRI socket path in connected Managed Clusters from the default path.

## Value

Runtime View collects image information from the pods running in your Managed Clusters by using the CRI interface on the nodes
they're running on. By default, Kubernetes uses Containerd and the socket path is located at `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`,
but some systems use different CRI implementations or the containerd socket is located somewhere else.

If the location of the CRI socket is not the default value, you will need to update this path for your Managed Clusters
before enabling the Runtime View.

## Before you begin

**Required**

Find out what the CRI socket path for you Managed Clusters is. If it is something other than `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`,
you will need to change the path in our system.

Below is a list of systems that are known to use CRI implementations other than Containerd, or the Containerd socket
is located some other than the default location:
1. Rancher uses cri-dockerd, so the CRI socket path should be located at `/var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.
2. EKS installations with kubernetes version lower than 1.23 use docker shim, located at `/var/run/dockershim.sock`
3. RKE2 installation use Containerd but it's located at `/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock`
4. Installations of Kubernetes versions lower than 1.23 might be using `dockershim` by default, located at `/var/run/dockershim.sock`

**Configuring the CRI socket path for Managed Cluster**

To update the CRI socket path for your Managed Cluster use the following command:
```bash
kubectl patch imageassurance default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"criSocketPath":"<path-to-cri-socket>"}}'
```

See [the installation reference](../reference/installation/api.mdx#image-assurance.operator.tigera.io/v1.ImageAssuranceSpec) for more details on the ImageAssurance CR.
